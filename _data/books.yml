- title: Activist Trauma & Recovery 
  summary: >
    One of the amazing things about activists is that we often
    deliberately expose ourselves to brutality when we believe it
    necessary. What is sometimes equally surprising is how little
    we know about the psychological effects of this violence. We
    need to prepare ourselves and learn how to support each other
    through the physical and emotional consequences of trauma.
